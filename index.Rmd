### **Howdy!  Welcome to my personal page!**

<br>

My name is **Zenghui Xue**. I am from China, and currently a first year student in the program of Master of Science in Biostatistics in Columbia University. 

Before I came to Columbia University, I worked as a Ph.D. student in a developmental and cellular biology lab in Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. Now I define myself as a biologist trying to learn more about quantitative theories and methods. Please step forwards to my [**CV here**](cv.html).
